## Performance

Wallpaper Engine is designed to provide an entertaining experience while using minimal system resources. You can choose to automatically pause or completely stop the wallpaper while using other applications or playing games in fullscreen (including borderless windowed mode), ensuring that it doesn't distract you. There are many settings to adjust quality and performance, allowing you to make Wallpaper Engine fit your system perfectly. 

As a general rule, 3D, 2D, and video-based wallpapers perform best, while websites and applications may require more system resources. A dedicated GPU is highly recommended, but not mandatory.
